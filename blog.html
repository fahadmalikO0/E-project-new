                    <h1>let’s talk about Lakmé.</h1>
                    <p style="font-family: 'EB Garamond', serif;">Every Indian, whether they care or not, knows of Lakmé. Year after year, we hear about celebrities walking down the runway for the elegant Lakmé Fashion Week with India’s top fashion designers and of course the endless ads featuring Kareena Kapoor Khan on our television screens. However, there is something seriously problematic with Lakmé’s cosmetics range which is something most people have so far failed to address and that is their non-inclusive complexion products.

                        Lakmé is one of the Indian brands that is considered to be at par with foreign brands across many fields – retail, automobile, telecommunication and so on. It’s a home-grown brand that has been around for decades with the primary intention that Indians shouldn’t spend foreign exchange on foreign brands. It was started for the Indian woman and to help boost and promote more indigenous businesses. The problem now, staring every consumer in the face today, is that it’s painfully obvious that a majority of the Indian people don’t have Kareena’s skin tone and it’s frustrating to see an entire brand, created for people in a country with typically brown skin, produce and advertise products solely for light skin tones.
                        
                        In 2017, Rihanna launched her infamous makeup line Fenty Beauty that took the cosmetics industry by storm. The foundation line had 40 different shades to choose from where for the first time, 10 of those shades were dedicated to “deep” skin tones. Following this, several brands were either praised or severely criticised depending on their latest launch of skin products. For example, Kylie Cosmetics launched concealers with 30 shades which people applauded and famously, Tarte launched their most anticipated foundation (Tarte Shape Tape Foundation) with 14 shades with just 2 shades for darker skin tones and they were heavily condemned and thrashed.
